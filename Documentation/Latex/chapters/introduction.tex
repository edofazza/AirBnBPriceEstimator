\section{Introduction}
Housing prices are an important reflection of the economy, and pricing a rental property on Airbnb, therefore, can be a challenging task for the owner as it determines the number of customers for the place. On the other hand, customers have to evaluate an offered price with minimal knowledge of an optimal value for the property. This projects aims to develop a price prediction model using a range of machine learning methods.

\subsection{Description}
\textbf{\textit{AirBnBPriceEstimator}} is a machine learning project for estimating the cost of a BnB property.
Parlare degli algoritmi che si useranno (da fare dopo gli altri capitoli).
