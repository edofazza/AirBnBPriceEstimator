\section{Preprocessing}

\subsection{What can be preprocessed now?}
Since we have to deal with classification problems, before preprocessing data we must be sure not to apply supervised filters on the whole dataset. If we need supervised filters, we must split the dataset in training set and test set before applying them. However, in our case there is no need for a supervised filters but  attribute selection, so we performed all the unsupervised preprocessing operations at the beginning, postponing the attribute selection after the training/test split.

\subsection{Data Cleaning and Reduction}
Since the Weka framework was not able to parse correctly the source file, for the following operations we used \textit{Microsoft Excel} and \textit{Apple Numbers}.

\subsubsection{Removing Noisy and Irrelevant attributes}
The first preprocessing operation is the attribute reduction, indeed we decided to remove all the features that are not domain-specific, nor useful for classification purposes. Among them we deleted:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ID}s: \textit{Bnb\_ID, scrape\_id, host\_id}
	\item \textbf{URL}s: \textit{listing\_url, picture\_url, host\_url, host\_thumbnail\_url, host\_picture\_url}
	\item Scraping informations like \textit{last\_scraped\_date, calendar\_last\_scraped}
	\item Useless information on the rent for classification purposes like \textit{name, description, first\_review\_date}
	\item Useless information about the host like \textit{host\_name, host\_location} (it is not the place in which the rent is, but where the host lives), \textit{host\_about, host\_has\_profile\_pic}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Removing Redundant Attributes}
The next step was the reduction of attributes explicitly redundant. For all of these we did not compute the $\chi^2$ test because of the explicit correlation between the features

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{host\_neighbourhood and neighbourhood} \textbf{w.r.t.} \textit{neighbourhood\_cleansed} are explicit redundancies; 	\textit{neighbourhood\_group\_cleansed} has been demonstrated to be very highly correlated with \textit{neighbourhood\_cleansed} ($P\{independence\}<0.05$)
	\item \textit{host\_total\_listings\_count} completely equal to \textit{host\_listing\_count}
	\item \textit{host verification} \textbf{w.r.t.} \textit{host\_identity\_verified}
	\item \textit{minimum\_minimum\_nights, minimum\_maximum\_nights, maximum\_minimum\_night, maximum\_maximum\_nights, minimum\_nights\_avg} and \textit{maximum\_nights\_avg} are redundancies of the \textit{attributes minimum\_nights} and \textit{maximum\_nights}
	\item \textit{review\_scores\_accuracy, review\_scores\_cleanliness, review\_scores\_checkin, review\_scores\_communications, review\_scores\_location, review\_scores\_value} are rounded values that have been more precisely combined in another already-existing attribute that is \textit{review\_scores\_rating}
	\item \textit{calculated\_host\_listings\_count} (+ category) are redundant attributes of \textit{listings\_count} valid only for their respective category
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Additional Removed Features}
Eventually, the other columns that have been discarded are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Attributes that strongly depend from the instant in which the scraping has been performed like \textit{has\_availability\_now, availability\_30, availability\_60, availability\_90, number\_of\_reviews\_ltm, number\_of\_reviews\_l30}
	\item Empty attributes like \textit{license}, \textit{bathrooms}
	\item Others, like \textit{latitude} and \textit{longitude} that are not more useful than the easier data on the neighborhood
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Dealing with Missing Fields}
Once the previous steps were performed, we achieved a \textbf{Weka-convertible CSV file}. Thus, the following steps have been implemented using the \textit{Java Weka API}.
The original dataset contains several missing values sparse in more than one attribute. The number of missing values is enough relevant to discourage the instance deletion, although they are pretty easy to handle, indeed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The majority of them are on numeric attributes characterized by low variance, like the \textit{response\_rate} ($\sigma =26.17$ on a $0-100$ interval) or the \textit{review\_score\_rating} ($\sigma=9.52$ on a $0-100$ interval). In these cases, replacing the missing value with the mean does not introduces big error rates.
	\item Some missing values can be easily inferred with the simple analysis by the domain expert: for example, the attribute \textit{bedrooms} contains missing values, but only when the corresponding \textit{beds} value is 1: it’s reasonable that the missing value for \textit{bedrooms} is 1 as well.
	\item Supervised approaches for missing values could have guaranteed more precise results, but since we are exploiting a regression problem and we didn’t split training and test sets yet, using a supervised filter here was an error.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Transformation}

\subsubsection{Attribute Formats Transformation}
Some of the attributes persisted after the cleaning and reduction phases of the precedent sections were in a not suitable state for the knowledge discovery operation that will be done in chapter 3. Thus, we decide to transform those attribute to make them adequate for classification. The features we transformed are: \textit{amenities} (we will discuss them in chapter 2.4.2), \textit{bathrooms}, and \textit{price}.

The \textit{bathrooms} in the scraped file were two columns, one empty and removed and the other one containing string values as "Shared bath", "1 shared bath", "1.5 bath". We manage to format it in two columns, one referring to the number of bathrooms inside the building and the other telling if the bathrooms are shared or not.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/bath.png}  
\end{figure}

The \textit{price} attribute in the original file was a string made of \textit{\$} plus the amount (e.g., \textit{\$170}). We transformed it simply by removing the dollar sign.

\subsubsection{One Hot for the Amenities}
\textit{Amenities}, in the original file, were list of string inputed by the used that contain all the facility the specific BnB offers to the guests.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/amenities.png}  
\end{figure}

Structured in this way they were difficult to process. Because many machine learning models need their input variables to be numeric, we need to transform these categorical variables using the \textit{one-hot encoding}. One-hot encoding is a frequently used method to deal with categorical data, since many machine learning models need their input variables to be numeric, categorical variables need to be transformed in the pre-processing part.

\textit{"How did we proceed to create the one-hot table?"} First, we collect all the distinct values from the entries in the csv amenitites' column and we created new columns using them, through a first scan of the column. Then we made a second scan to compute the values of each of the newly created attribute: if the attribute name is the same of one is contained in the amenities' list we are considering, then we put a value equal to 1, otherwise we put 0. Obtaining something like this:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/onehot.png}  
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Amenities' One Hot refinements}
The number of columns obtained was very huge, more than three hundreds, so we needed to reduced them in some ways. We notice that few of them were irrelevant and the most of them were redundant, for all of these we did not compute the $\chi^2$ test because of the explicit correlation between the features (\textit{e.g.}, Keurig coffee machine, Coffee maker, Nespresso machine) but we simply merge them.

The irrelevant columns we removed through code, they were: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Limited housekeeping u2014 on request}: put just by one user and outdated nowadays;
	\item \textit{Safe}: put just by one user and without a consistent meaning. Without knowing if safe stands that the building is safe or that the BnB is located in a safe location, we decide to remove it.
\end{itemize}

The columns that were similar to each other were merged forming a new columns made of the values of the grouped columns. Merging was done through code, summing they values in each position:

$
	\ \ \ \	\ \ \ \	\ \ \ \	\ \ \ \		new\_column = \sum^{similar \ columns}_{i} columns_i
$

In the case of values inside the \textit{new\_column} greater than 1, we convert back to 1.
The merged columns were (\textit{new name for the column} \textrightarrow \textit{columns merged}):

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Preprocessing Implementation}
As already mentioned before, the preliminary operations needed to make the \textit{csv} readable by \textbf{Weka} have been performed using spreadsheet software. The resulting cleansed file still needs some modifications, \textit{i.e.}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item As reported in par. 2.3, missing values need to be managed
	\item As widely discussed in par. 2.4, the \textit{amenities} must be converted in a \textbf{One Hot}
	\item On the \textit{price} attribute, we get rid of the \$ sign and we convert it into numeric
	\item The \textit{bathroom} attribute needs its format to be changed
\end{itemize}

After the loading of the \textit{CSV} file, in order to speed up the operations we parallelized them using 4 different threads: the dataset is vertically split and every thread works only on its related partition, using \textit{Java Weka API} or working directly on the text according to what was the fastest approach in every single scenario; every execution flow, before ending, writes results in a \textit{CSV} file. The main thread spawns a thread for each of the tasks listed before, and then waits the termination of all of them before merging the results in a single file.

In addition to the benefits of parallelism, this approach promotes the separation of concerns of the tasks: the main method defines the preprocessing pipeline, but the actual operations on data are performed by separated and independent components. All the classes implemented at this point are collected in the \textit{com.unipi.dmaml.airbnbpriceestimator.preprocessing} package.
